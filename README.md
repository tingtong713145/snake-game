### In the demo mode, you can see how to play the game :).</br>
There are two strategies for the snake in the demo mode </br>
<ul>
<li>In the greedy strategy, if there is a danger in a direction, then snake will choose a suitable perpendicular direction. Otherwise, if the snake is vertically above food, and snake is moving in horizontal direction, then snake moves in a suitable vertical direction, else if not vertically above, and snake is moving in vertical direction, then choose a suitable horizontal direction </li>
<li>In the BFS search, the BFS search is done but since there is not a moving point but a body, so shifted body is also stored as danger can also be posed by snake body itself.</li> 
</ul>

#### It also has swipe gestures to make it easy to play on mobile phones .</br>
